                        In his lecture titled: From Harvey to me: Where do we go from here? Dr Oyedeyi listed factors affecting the development of Physiology to include poor public perception, loss of credibility as an independent discipline and lack of national relevance, among others.
                        <br>
                        He said: "To correct this anomaly, several measures must be taken. We must review the curriculum of Physiology in universities, which would enhance training of students on versatility in medical skills such as medical journalism and medical research."
                        <br>
                        Prof Abeyombo, who spoke on Physiology: The past, present and future, said the discipline was not popular among students at a time, noting that the importance of Physiology could not be overlooked in today's world. If Physiology is professionalised, she said, preventable deaths would be reduced.

                        Dr Nwoke, former Head of Physiology Department at the Ambrose Ali University (AAU) in Ekpoma, Edo State, took the students on the relevance of the discipline in today's society and why Physiology practice must be encouraged in health sector. <br>
                        He said: "In Nigeria, no patient has ever asked where the physiologists are; but it is the responsibility of physiologists to show their usefulness by complementing the efforts of doctors to save lives."
    
                        Dr Abdussalam-Magaji, a lecturer at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in Zaria, Kaduna State, took the students on neuroscience, which he described as a discipline that combines physiology, anatomy and the nervous system.
